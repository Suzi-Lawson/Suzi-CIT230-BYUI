            <h3>Tokyo Japan Temple</h3>
            <p><img id="ttemp" src="images/tokyojapan.jpg" alt="tokyo japan temple">
                Announced on August 9th, 1975 and dedicated on October 27th, 1980 by President Spencer W. Kimball, 
                the Tokyo Japan Temple (formally known as Tokyo Temple) became the 20th 
                temple built by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. It is also 
                the first temple to be built in Asia. Until the announcement on April 10th, 2017 and
                the actual closure of the temple in October 2017 for renovations, Tokyo Temple 
                was the 18th temple of the church in opperation. Completion and rededication is 
                anticipated in the year 2020. 
                The Tokyo Japan Temple is a beautiful structure that sits on less than half an 
                acre of land. It is bordered on one side by a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints 
                stake center and sits across from Arisugawa-no-miya Memorial Park. The temple was originally 
                built without an Angel of Moroni statue. A ceromony on December 10, 2004 took place to add the 
                iconic symbol of the church.
